OTHER NOTES:
The Mail pocket has been replaced with "General Held Items", and Battle Items with "Special Held Items". As a result X Items have been moved to the MEDICINE POCKET!

WE ARE DEFINITELY MISSING SOME PEOPLE. IF YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHO PLEASE MENTION SUCH!

NOTES ABOUT THIS GAME SPECIFICALLY!:
Shadow Pokemon are obtainable ingame with their own special events. The Shadow type is supereffective on every type but Fairy (resists) and Dark (immune).

Saves are stored in the 'Pokemon Animosity' folder of this game.

Other stuff has some interesting notes and details about the game itself it is suggested to read. **Optional though!**

PLANNED FEATURES FOR THE FUTURE:
- Alphabetically sorted items
- Buffs are added as the game is updated and progresses.
